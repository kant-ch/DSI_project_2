## Problem statement
1. Invent model to evaluate proper price of the property according to appointed features.
2. Matching property features and clients.

## Background
1. We are seeking new opportunity in Ames, Iowa ( aka Happy Trees Town)
2. Studying dataset for property investment to match clientâ€™s need
    - Low price-sale

### Summary 
Total column : 82 columns
Object 43 columns
Numerical data 39 columns

## 2. Data cleaning

There are some of missing data is NMAR type. (From data_description.txt file) The meaning of missing value in each columns is in table below.

|Columns|Desciption|
|:------|:---------|
|pool_qc           | No pool
|misc_feature      | None misc feature
|alley             | No alley access
|fence             | No fence
|fireplace_qu      | No fireplace
|garage_yr_blt     | No Garage 
|garage_qual       | No Garage 
|garage_cond       | No Garage 
|garage_finish     | No Garage 
|garage_type       | No Garage 
| bsmt_exposure    | No basement
| bsmtfin_type_2   | No basement
| bsmtfin_type_1   | No basement
| bsmt_cond        | No basement
|bsmt_qual         | No basement
| mas_vnr_area     | Maybe actually missing
| mas_vnr_type     | Maybe actually missing
| bsmtfin_sf_2     | No basement

### Handing missing value
We divide handling the missing value into 3 group.
1. Large amount of missing value: Drop columns because it may decrease accuracy of the model.

2. Not too large or NMAR type missing value: Impute appropiate value into the column.

**Note** - Some column has text `'No'` represent absense of the value e.g. garage and basement column.

3. Small amount of missing value: Impute appropiate value into the column.

## 3. Exploration data analysis
In this section, we explore data by using correlation and prepare data for training linear regression model.

### Comparison between eliminate and not eliminate outlier
**Compare by using scatterplot**
1. left-handed side graphs are data without eliminate outlier. 
    - Orange line is boundary of saleprice.
    - Red line is boundary of column in x-axis.


2. right-handed side graph are data with eliminate outlier.
    - Outlier are manually eliminated.
    - We decide to eliminate outlier in gr_liv_area, garage_area and total_bsmt_sf columns.

**Note** - For 2 right-handed side point of the graph saleprice vs total_bsmt_sf with outlier, we don't eliminate them because they are gone with above elimination.

After elimination of outlier, The relation between `gr_liv_area` `garage_area` `total_bsmt_sf` and sale price is better.


## 4. Feature engineering
In this project, we have 2 section of feature engineering e.g. log transform column and encoding columns

1. Log tranformation
    - We transform the `saleprice` column by using `np.log()` because the difference between scale of x and y.
    - Expectation: we expect to see more linearity after transforming `saleprice` column

After take log to `saleprice`, `saleprice` scale is smaller and the correlation should be more linear. It may help to improve the linear regression model.

2. One-hot encoding
    - We use only one-hot encoding on few numeric feature. The idea is applied one-hot encoding for numeric feature that is category/ordinal.
    - Reason: Eventhough, the value in `numeric_category_col` is numeric, each value in the column represent the categotical data instead of the number.
    
## 5. Training model
In this section, we will train the model and check for bias, variance, split reliabilty and model performance.

### Model selection
We don't use the lasso regression because lasso may penalize all of coefficient to zero. Since we don't require model in the sweet spot, we decide to use ridge regression.

## 6. Model result
After we got the model result, we need to check the performance of the model.
1. Check Bias (underfitting): The model has high $R^{2}$ value. Then the model is not underfitting.
2. check Variance (overfitting): The $R^{2}$ of train set is similar to $R^{2}$ of test set. Then the model is not overfitting.
3. Split reliability: The 5 value of $R^{2}$ from cross validation don't diverge. Then the model performance don't rely on spliting data. 
4. Model performance:
    - $R^{2}$ training set = 0.9263
    - $R^{2}$ test set = 0.919
    - RMSE training set = 19489
    - RMSE test set = 20956
    
## 7. Conclusion and recommendation
### Conclusion
1. Model RMSE has decreased 37 % which lead to return on property investment increase by 27 %.
2. House Pricing Prediction could personlize based on customer demand in individual house features i.e. number of Garage, Lot Space etc. 
3. Some feature could be selectively stored to optimize between cost of storage and model performance i.e. pool_qc ,misc_feature etc.

### Recommendation
1. To explore more predictively powerful algorithm.
2. To customize key features based on individual city.
3. To expand new opportunities in other cities in the U.S. and the world.
